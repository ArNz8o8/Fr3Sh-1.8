Thesaurus support for bMotion
-----------------------------

So I thought it might be fun for bMotion to be able to replace words with synonyms :)

In order to enable this, you will need:

* SQLite support in your TCL
* The Moby Thesaurus List by Grady Ward:
  http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3202
* Python

And what you do is this:

* Extract the files from the Thesaurus zip file.
* Run: python import_thes.py
* Assuming it all goes OK, you should end up with a nice big .db file.
* Put the .db file into the local/ dir in your bMotion install.
