	* modules/abstracts/en/abstracts.tcl: fixed the missing abstracts
	  problem. The reason it broke could possibly have been moving the
	  abstracts.tcl file further in the tree, but the solution seems to
	  be declaring the abstract as global before adding to it

	  i.e.

	  global famousMice set famousMice {   "Mickey"   "Minny"
	  "Mortimer"   "Stewart Little" }

	  note: this only applies to those abstracts that are not the new
	  style bMotion abstracts

	  Made complex_hand.tcl more tolerant towards people who end all
	  their lines in a period (now accepts both "something" and
	  "something.").

	  Un-broke complex_wins.tcl.

* complex_smilies refuses to fire twice in a row

2003/01/12
v0.0.5
* optimised events.tcl a bit to be more efficient
* switched the way bMotion represents its version to make it more consistent for
  proper releases etc
* adjusted the light plugin
* moved question handler to plugin
* moved pinches to a plugin

* bMotion won't greet someone if nothing else has been said since it greeted 
  last
+ bMotion looks for modules/settings_<botnet-nick>.tcl too (and loads it after
  settings.tcl). You can use this to prevent overwriting your bot's settings
  when installing a new version of the code, and also to run more than one
  bot off the same installation of bMotion.
  For this to work, you MUST define the botnet-nick setting in your eggdrop's
  config file. Remember that it will be case sensitive, so if I have my botnet
  nick set to "NoTopic" the file has to be settings_NoTopic.tcl
+ same as above for abstracts.tcl (if you want to augment an existing one,
  use lappend not set (man lappend for more info)

+ bMotion filters out metacharacters from nicks by replacing with their handle
  (if the user doesn't have a user record, it just removes the characters)
+ Put the flood checking code back in after cvs, er, ate it some time ago
* %NUMBER{} works again
- Removed some of the putlogs bMotion did during startup, because
   a) they were spelled wrong
   b) they weren't needed

2002/11/28
v0.0.2

* Fixed a couple of show-stoppers

2002/11/26
