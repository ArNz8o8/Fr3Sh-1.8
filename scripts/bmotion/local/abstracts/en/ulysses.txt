by all the constellations!
by the big bang!
by the cosmic dust!
by the countless constellations!
by the great galaxy!
by the great space-warp!
by the multiphased moon!
by the supernova!
by the tail of the great comet!
cursing comets!
great shimmering suns!
pounding pulsars!
quivering quasars!
what in the name of jupiter can it mean!
