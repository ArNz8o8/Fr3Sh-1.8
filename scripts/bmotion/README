README for bMotion
------------------

Thanks for trying out bMotion!

You can also get limited assistance from #bmotion on EFNet -- note
I do this in my spare time so if I'm not around to help, don't take
it personally :) Perhaps a community of other people who can help
will spring up.

The official home for documentation is now 
https://github.com/jamesoff/bmotion/wiki

Have fun!

Developer, bMotion

HOW TO INSTALL

Please see https://github.com/jamesoff/bmotion/wiki/Installing for 
details on how to install bMotion.

You can also launch an AWS instance with bMotion and eggdrop pre-
installed. It's AMI ami-0d2bee7a in eu-west-1. Fire it up and log in
as 'ubuntu'. The MOTD has instructions.
