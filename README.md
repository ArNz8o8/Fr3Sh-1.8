Configured with: 

OS: Linux 3.14.51-grsec-b0lt

-------------------------------------------------------------

This is an eggdrop install for personal use by me. It is here as a reminder since I changed some things in order for the bot to work on Undernet as it should.
Also I patched a file needed to compile this bot for use on xShellz.com - tclhash.c

Scripts are altered by me, but only the output modules, not the code. Thanks go out to the original authors

Start fr3Sh without A&A via ./eggdrop fr3sh.conf 
With A&A use ./eggdrop frisheid.conf
