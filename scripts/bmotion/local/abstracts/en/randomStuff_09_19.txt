Avast, me proud beauty! Wanna know why my Roger is so Jolly?
C'mere, me beauty
Come on up and see me urchins
Drink up, me hearties!
How'd you like to scrape the barnacles off of me rudder
Is that a hornpipe in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me?
Prepare to be boarded
Rum tastes horrible, and I hate wearing this eye-patch.
Well, me hearties, let's see what crawled out of the bung hole

mmm grog and wenches
mmm wenches
